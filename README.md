## Overview
 
### Writing professional documents

Many of you likely already have a document which functions as a résumé. For those of you who do not, or for those of you whose professional documents might need a bit more than a touch-up, this assignment offers the opportunity to use a variety of resources, including your peers, to develop a complete document which takes your career narrative work into account. Rather than the somewhat abstract terms that your narrative might use, your résumé should be focused on the discrete and specific characteristics of either your education or current employment history which _demonstrate_ skills required of a professional position.

I write "résumé" a lot in the above paragraph. For some of you, you'll be looking more squarely at a curriculum vitae (C.V.). Our readings this week highlight the differences between the traditional résumé and C.V. In many places outside the United States (and increasingly _inside_ the U.S.), these terms are interchangeable. However, insofar as graduate schools, fellowships, and some professional positions require, the document requested is somewhat different. More often, programs are beginning to request résumés. 

Based on your opportunity search conducted over the last week, make a choice as to which document is more appropriate for you.

## Assignment guidelines

Depending on the opportunity/opportunities that you're interested in pursuing, you'll choose to either create a résumé, C.V., or -- in a rare circumstance -- you might consider both. For this assignment, I'd likely err on the side of choosing the document you need more immediately (e.g. a résumé for a full-time or internship posting).

By the end of this activity you should have completed a full draft of whichever document you've chosen following the guidelines below.

### Résumé

1. A final product which:
  * is _no more than_ a `1` page document
  * "passes" the [résumé review checklist](https://tswqo1aqh6e4d9omrzpjqmtw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/career/files/2019/01/RESUME-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.pdf)
  * is included in this repository as a `.pdf` or `.docx` file (preferably a `.pdf` to preserve your formatting) in the `documents` directory
2. A text-only version of the résumé as a `.txt` or `.rtf` file
  * This, while annoying, is actually essential to have
  * It should preserve some amount of formatting and **_should not be_** just an export from a word processor
3. Draft work completed as part of class activities in the `draft` folder
4. A copy of the original posting that you used to tailor this document

### C.V.

1. A final product which:
  * is a 1+ page document
  * "passses" the [C.V. review checklist](http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/counseling/Curriculum%20Vitae%20Review%20Checklist.pdf) and general principles in Northeastern's [How to Write a Grad School Résumé](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/how-to-write-a-grad-school-resume/)
  * is included in this repository as a `.pdf` or `.docx` file (preferably a `.pdf` to preserve your formatting) in the `documents` directory
2. A copy of the original posting/program requirements that you used to tailor this document
